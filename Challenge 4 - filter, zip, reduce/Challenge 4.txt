## filter, zip and reduce in Python


1. Convert a number to positive if it's negative in the list. Only pass those that are converted from negative to positive to the new list.

Tip: Use `map()` function is inside `filter()` function.

Input:
```
lst1 = [-1000, 500, -600, 700, 5000, -90000, -17500]
```



2. Take the first two values, run the function on them. 

Then take the result and the next value and have a multiplication between them, etc.

When no more values are left, then return the last result.

Tip: Use `reduce` function. 



3. Using zip and dict functions create a dictionary which has its key-value pairs coming from `lst1` and `lst2`.

Input:
```
lst1 = ["Netflix", "Hulu", "Sling", "Hbo"]
lst2 - [198, 166, 237, 125]
```
