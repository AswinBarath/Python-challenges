## File Handling and Exception Handling in Python


### Problem Statement 1


Write an interactive calculator!

User input is assumed to be a formula that consist of a number, an operator (at least + and -) and another number, seperated by white space (e.g. 1 + 1).

Split user input using str.split() and check whether the resulting list is valid:

If the input does not consist of 3 elements, raise a FormulaError, which is a custom Exception.

Try to convert the first and third input to a float. Catch any ValueError that occurs, and instead raise a FormulaError.

If the second input is not '+' or '-', again raise a FormulaError.

If the input is valid, perform the calculation and print out the result. The user is then promoted to provide new input, and so on, until the user enters quit.



### Problem Statement 2


Write a **python script** to identify the longest words in the file: `a.txt`.
