# Challenge 5

## Decorators and Generators in Python


1. Write a decorator which will take a function and execute it twice.

The Input function
```
def multiply(num1, num2):
	print(num1 * num2)
```



2. Create a generator to return the fibonacci sequence starting from the first element up to `n`.

The fibonacci sequence looks like this:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`
